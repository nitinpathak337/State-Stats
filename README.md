Hey Guys,

This is the statestats app I have built using React, ApexCharts and Bootstrap.



To start the application in local:

Clone the repo in your IDE
Run command 'npm i' to install the dependencies.
Run command 'npm start' to start the application.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser
